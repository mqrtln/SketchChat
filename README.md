# SketchChat


# A Live chatting client with Firebase database and authentication in backend

### Under construction - 0.1 build up on firebase: https://sketchlandchat.web.app/


### Known issues: 
  - If you refresh the site when youre at the /chat endpoint the page 404s
  - Right now this is not a live chat since the Websocket is not integrated in the deployed version
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  If you clone this i'm sorry for the bad code quality - i did this for fun in about 4 days so there is no design principles in place
